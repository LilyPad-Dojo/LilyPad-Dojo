         <p>Solar panels can include two completely different things - solar hot water or solar photovoltaics. Solar hot water panels have a liquid that captures heat from the sun to heat your water, whereas photovoltaics (PV) are used to convert sunlight directly into electricity to be used immediately or stored in a battery.</p>


         <p>PV arrays are generally able to provide all the electricity a home uses, assuming the house has reasonably good solar access (free of shade from large trees or nearby buildings, and reasonably good southern or western exposure). If a home is particularly energy efficient, or certain climate factors exist, the potential exists for over-generation - the generation of electricity in excess of what the home uses.</p>

         <p>Most utilities in the US have some form of what is known as Net Energy Metering (NEM) in place. NEM is an electric rate structure that allows a solar generator to make and consume electricity through the same meter, what is sometimes referred to as “running the meter backwards.” Since solar PV production varies by time of day as well as time of year, and usage (consumption) is not synchronized with this production, an annual settlement calculation is performed, and net consumption is charged, while net production is often compensated.</p>

         <p>Since the energy generated by the residential system is offset against consumption, effectively the homeowner is being paid retail rates for the energy generation. This is almost always more than the cost of energy production from the homeowner’s system, creating a profit margin. Said another way, if a homeowner can produce electricity for less than the utility charges for it, each kilowatt-hour generated is money in the homeowner’s pocket, which eventually pays off the investment in the PV system.</p>

         <p>Annual net production in excess of usage is usually compensated at the wholesale market rate, not the retail rate. This should be considered when sizing the PV system, especially when budgets are tight.</p>

        <h2>Solar PV Economics example</h2>
         <p>A typical utility has electric rates that can vary by time of year, time of day, previous usage in the same billing period, and the nature of the user, making analysis complicated if you need to be accurate. But a typical residential customer in a California investor-owned utility, such as PG&E, will end up paying about 25 cents per kilowatt-hour, if you simplify and just divide the end-of-month cost by the usage.</p>

         <p>Let’s say a typical residential system costs $24,000 after taxes, rebates etc., and produces 12,500 kWh/yr. If it runs for 20 years without any maintenance or further cost, then the cost per kilowatt-hour produced will be: $24,000/(12,500 kWh/yr)(20 yr) = $0.096 /kWh or roughly ten cents.</p>

         <p>Wholesale power costs can be complicated as are retail rates, but over a 12-month average, our northern California example has a wholesale price of about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour.</p>

         <p>To sum up the conclusions from this example, with solar PV one could generate electricity for about 10 cents/kWh, and offset purchases at 25 cents/kWh. Any power overgenerated at the end of a 12-month period would be compensated at 6 cents/kWh. If the home uses about 10,000 kWh/yr, that's (10,000 kWh/yr)(25 cents/kWH) + (2,500 kWh)(6 cents/kWh) = $2650 / yr, or $53,000 over 20 yrs - $29,000 saved after subtracting the initial purchase price of the PV system.</p>
