         <p>The management of energy, air, and moisture flows in a house is arguably the most important part of designing a high-performance house. The first thing to be done to reduce energy use in a structure is to minimize heat loss through the skin of the building, with insulation. Air leaking in through that skin must all be heated or cooled by the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, so leaks need to be reduced. After the house is well sealed and insulated, moisture from inside sources such as bathing, cooking, or breathing, as well as outside humidity, must be appropriately dealt with.</p>

        <p>Repercussions from moisture include condensation inside walls and other building components, causing dry rot and destruction of building materials. High indoor humidity can encourage unhealthful mold and other fungal growth.</p>

        <h1>Heat Recovery Ventilation</h1>

        <p>A very tightly air-sealed house goes a long way towards reducing the need to heat or cool outside air that leaks into the house and thereby saves energy. But that leaking air did have one beneficial purpose: diluting pollution. A tight house that does not bring in much outside air has the potential to accumulate pollutants. A smarter way to provide clean air than uncontrolled outside air leaks is to install a Heat Recovery Ventilator (HRV) allowing control of the airflow with less energy loss.</p>

        <p>A Heat Recovery Ventilator (HRV) is a heat exchanger and fan unit that provides a continuous low volume of airflow for fresh air purposes. Because of the heat exchanger, the HRV recovers some 90% of the sensible heat from the air stream leaving the building and transfers it to the incoming stream of fresh outside air. HRVs also incorporate a filter to clean the incoming air.</p>

            <figcaption>An HRV Recovers Hot and Cold Air</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>An HRV allows houses with a high degree of airtightness to meet minimum amounts of fresh air required by standards developed by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers.</p>

        <p>Pollutants that are generated inside the house include particulates from cooking, combustion products from gas burners, candles, open fireplaces, air fresheners and other aerosol sprays, and more. Attached garages are also sources of pollutants including car exhaust and stored chemicals. Breathing the air by occupants also depletes the oxygen which needs to be replenished. If combustion appliances are not vented outdoors then these burners will also deplete oxygen and replace it with carbon dioxide and dangerous carbon monoxide.  The HRV keeps the air quality high, fresh, and the occupants healthy. (Of course it also helps to replace all those combustrion appliances with clean electric ones!)</p>

        <h1>Air Sealing</h1>

        <iframe class="embedded-youtube" width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHyZEazGwa8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>Air leaking into a well-constructed house circa 2000 comes in through gaps and cracks around windows and doors, where wall top plates and bottom plates join ceiling and floor construction, between sheets of plywood in the subfloor, around electrical and plumbing penetrations, and other places. If you add together all the cracks and leaky spaces in that year-2000 home, it would typically add up to a hole in the building about a 2-foot square in size. Today’s techniques reduce that hole to about a 6-inch square.</p>

        <p>When air sealing first started becoming an emphasis by progressive builders in the 70’s and early 80’s, the sealing membrane of choice was polyethylene. Applied to the interior (winter heated) side of the studs under the drywall, it did an admirable job of blocking air leaks and water vapor migration. This performs wonderfully in high-altitude, mountainous locations, but in hot humid climates such as the southeastern United States it’s a different story.</p>

        <p>When hot, humid outdoor air comes into contact with the inner-wall vapor barrier, where the temperature is lower because the air conditioner is running, the water vapor condenses on the surface inside the wall, causing moisture, dry rot, mold growth, and wood destruction. So just put the vapor barrier on the outside, you say? That would work in the summer, but then in the winter you’d get the opposite effect with interior-generated vapor condensing on the cold outer barrier, again inside the wall.</p>

        <p>Therefore, it’s important to consider that no matter what your climate, conditions can come to pass that will cause liquid water to form inside the wall, and to leave available a path for the moisture to dry. Today’s housewraps allow partial permeability of vapor while blocking liquid water, creating a path for water inside walls to dry out. By considering and protecting against potential damage due to water collecting, you can prevent such issues. Also, using innovative materials such as Denshield waterproof wallboard instead of standard sheetrock can help minimize moisture issues when they do occur.</p>

        <p>Air sealing can be accomplished through different techniques, such as liberal use of caulking and gasketing, coatings like STS, seam sealing tape, or a combination of these. Special attention should be given to areas where planes intersect, such as where the walls meet the ceiling, and all utility penetrations such as electrical outlets and plumping connections. Doors and windows must also be of high quality, and casements are generally preferred over sliders so they can form a tight seal when closed</p>

            <figcaption>How a Blower Door Test Measures Air Leakage</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>A blower door test is the standard method to detect leaks in a home. A special apparatus designed just for this purpose, a blower door is an adjustable  frame with a ripstop nylon skin that adjusts to fit tightly into a door opening. The blower door has a built-in fan and a pressure gauge so it can create a controlled positive pressure in your house. (Some tests may pull a vaccuum instead, but pressurization is generally preferred to avoid sucking dirt into the home.)</p>

        </figure>

        <p>This small pressure difference is enough to cause air to leak out of the house wherever it can. If the air outside is significantly cooler or warmer than the inside, then the leaks will cause temperature differences to appear that can then be viewed through infrared thermography. Small ribbons or handheld fog generators can also be used to track down the leaks. Places to look for leaks to seal would be where walls and floors or ceilings meet, where there are penetrations such as electrical outlets or recessed lights, and around doors and windows. Most leaks can be sealed up, but sometimes they can be tricky, especially in retrofits like LilyPad - don't expect to get as good a seal in a remodel project as new construction.</p>

        <p>A blower door test will result in a score that is expressed as Air Changes per Hour at 50 Pascal (ACH50). The video on the topic of Blower Door Testing gives a table that interprets an ACH50 score in terms of relative leakiness or points in various rating systems.</p>

        <h1>External Insulation</h1>

        <p>LilyPad uses the Dryvit system, with a 2” EPS insulation layer. It not only provides continuous insulation (outsulation) that breaks thermal bridges, but incorporates a water-resistive barrier, a drainage plane, and a finish coat that is extraordinarily flat and smooth. With the color embedded in the finish coat, the surface is virtually maintenance-free.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Other common continuous insulation barriers include polyisocyanurate board (polyiso) with or without the foil radiant barrier facing, taped at the seams. A relatively new product called InSoFast has 2-½” of EPS foam with embedded plastic “studs” that give a firm substrate for attaching siding, and come with an molded-in rain drainage channel. The panels come in 2’x4’ pieces.</p>

        <p class="clear"><strong>How to Insulate the High-Performance House</strong></p>
        <p>One of the most important things to do to make a house high performing is to insulate well. But how do you decide what level and type of insulation to use?
        In order to meet minimum code levels of insulation you will likely be installing fiberglass batts in the cavities of the walls in between the studs. These batts will be nominally R-13 (for 2x4 walls) or R-21 (for 2x6 walls). However, the finished result will be less than this for these reasons:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Insulation can be installed with voids at top, bottom, or sides of stud bays</li>
        <li>Insulation can have voids around wiring, plumbing, and other in-wall obstructions</li> 
        <li>The studs themselves have an R-value of only 5, and this is part of the average insulation of the entire wall</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you assume that the wall is constructed of 2x4s on 16” centers, then the average R-value of that wall with R-13 insulation batts is 12.25. Blown-in insulation is one way to avoid voids and improve the true R-value - LilyPad used JM Spider Plus Blow-In fiberglass insulation because of it's interlocking fiber technology that resists settling over time, and simplifies installation by removing the need for netting to hold the insulation in place before installing wallboard.</p>

        <p><strong>Exterior Continuous Insulation</strong></p>
        <p>If you were to install a layer of 1” rigid foam insulation with an R-value of 6 to the exterior side of that wall, the wall would be R-18.25. Installing that same insulation into the stud bay (say with spray foam) would yield an overall R-value of only 17.7 for this typical wall. Not only is the material therefore more effective, but it also results in the studs themselves being warmer (in winter heating mode) thereby resulting in less moisture condensation inside the wall, which can prevent mold and dry rot. The following infrared thermography provided by Dow Chemical shows this effect visually:</p>
